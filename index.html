	These are my battle scars, my stretch
	marks. They tell me you still love me
	and want me. The next time you're 
	insecure about your imperfections,
	think about whether you value me any
	less for mine. We've been through
	many things together! 
  </pre>
  <pre class="text" id="text2">
	I've been on many adventures in this life.
	I wish you could still take me places,
	like how you did when you were younger.
	It gets a little lonely when you’re away
	on long vacations.
  </pre>
  <pre class="text" id="text3">
	You named me Gendut when you were a child,
	because at the time I seemed so large.
	I'm a little less sturdy now, as some of my
	stuffing has fallen out or lost its fluff, 
	but these stitches help keep me together.
  </pre>
  <pre class="text" id="text4">
	This is where you would smell me when
	you need comfort. I'm falling apart at 
	the seams here, stuffing exposed, but 
	but it’s only a reminder that I’ve
	been well-loved.
  </pre>
  <pre class="text" id="text5">
	I'm glad I could be there for you for
	so many years. Thank you for choosing
	me to be your lifelong pillow companion! 
  </pre>
  <pre class="question" id="question1">
	You've had many surgeries.
	How do you feel about them?
  </pre>
  <pre class="question" id="question2">
	What can I do to be a better owner?
  </pre>
  <pre class="question" id="question3">
	What do you think of your name, Gendut?
	Remind me why I named you that.
  </pre>
  <pre class="question" id="question4">
	Do you feel sensitive here? 
  </pre>
  <pre class="question" id="question5">
	Thanks for the comfort you've provided me
	over the years, and for always being 
	there for me!
